Anyone can teach. Everyone can learn. Even professors. 

POSSE (The Professor's Open Source Summer Experience) was a 3 day bootcamp for the brightest minds in computer science on our campus, and from campuses near and far, to *learn*?

I was there just as a volunteer, just to help, just to listen, just to learn too. In those few short days, I learned bedrock concepts that would become the foundation of my pedagogical approach to teaching and learning, but there was one particular pearl of wisdom that shone above all.

"Be Productively Lost."

It is jarring, terrifying even, especially as the more of an expert you become, to not understand. To feel lost, to feel ignorant, to feel like a beginner. The further you progress from the beginning of your journey, the more daunting it feels to start over.

The more you learn to not only accept but *embrace* this discomfort, the better you become at traveling the paths of the Unknown. Fear of being Lost keeps people from seeking and from finding. You will forgo entire universes of possibility if you stick only to what you know, and are unwilling to take the risk.

You taught us not only about how learning to be comfortable in strange spaces and strange lands makes you a more capable traveler--less afraid of the roads less traveled--but you also taught us how to leave breadcrumb trails to find your way back.

You taught me about the true meaning of Pioneering. Not merely going deeper into the unknown for the sake of going first, or going furthest, but so that you could bring as many people with you after, or even along the way.

Documentation, storytelling, questions, answers, sharing, doing, working, living, Openly. 

This is the way. 

This is the way that you feel not so lost. By sensemaking and orienteering and leaving breadcrumbs for yourself and for others. By teaching, by sharing, you best understand your journey. 

And what's more illuminating than all of that--counter to the tired and supremely destructive tropes hackers continue repeating to ourselves about "basement dwelling lone-wolf geniuses" who only by gift of chance or birth are singularly capable of great feats of wizardry in the magic of coding--you showed us that no one is nor needs be alone on that journey. 

It is amongst The Community that you experience not only the support to navigate the Unknown, but the Triumph of Discovery--of finding and being found. 

I have repeated to every new traveler beginning their own Hacker's journey, *every single one of them*, these 3 seemingly simple words. Be Productively Lost. They changed my life, and I know they have changed the lives of hundreds of others.

And that was before watching you live them.

Becoming an exemplar of Pioneering. Starting over. Facing the unknown. Learning entirely new languages. Moving to new entirely places. Surmounting the highest levels of academia. Facing the unimaginable challenges of an uncooperative body, housing one the most collaborative minds I have ever known. It is the definition of Tragedy. Losing so soon such a bright mind, to such senseless, dark, circumstances.

But when it is darkest, light shines brightest.

I would offer 3 different quotes from 3 different times that each emanate from that same intellectual and spiritual wisdom that you shared with us, within which I find peace and purpose, and I hope you will too.

"Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds."

"Those who light their candle at mine, receive light, without darkening me."

"Thousands of candles can be lit by a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened."

Thank you for being unafraid to be lost, thank you for being brave enough to
go into the dark,  and thank you, eternally, for not just shining bright, but
for teaching us all how to light the way for eachother <3
